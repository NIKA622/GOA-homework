1-nagazi The Caucasian Shepherd is a massive, fearless dog from the Caucasus Mountains, originally bred to protect property and land. Known for their strength and loyalty, they have a thick coat for cold weather. They are deeply loving toward their owner and family, forming strong bonds, but they need an experienced handler to guide them with confidence.
The Bald Eagle has been the national emblem of the United States since 1782 and a spiritual symbol for native people for far longer than that. These regal birds aren’t really bald, but their white-feathered heads gleam in contrast to their chocolate-brown body and wings. Look for them soaring in solitude, chasing other birds for their food, or gathering by the hundreds in winter. Once endangered by hunting and pesticides, Bald Eagles have flourished under protection.
